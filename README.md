# customer-segmentation-k-means

Customer Segmentation and Analysis means grouping and clustering of customers based on marketing groups and their purchase behavior. To be more exact, segmenting customers and their characteristics is the best way to do product marketing especially in online shops, e-commerce and retail stores (Profitwell, 2021). By using clustering methods , we can find different people with different product interests and their purchase behavior. This can be a great factor to the companies to analyze characteristics of clients wants and needs and help them to improve their products and marketing strategies. In addition, product clustering analysis can be also applied in business decision making and achieve company goals. According to Niosi (2021), there are three segment a company may use to identify customers in their purchase behavior these are High (customers who buy often and spend more time in the platform), Medium (average customers in spending on the platform, that not much frequent visit) and Low ( not really visiting and purchasing in the platform). By use of this segmentation, machine learning can be applied on what the customers activity in purchasing a product. </br></br>

This is where our algorithm and Machine Learning provide solutions and reveal patterns for better decision making.

# methodology 

There are four sections to be considered </br>

•	Business Understanding </br>
•	Data Pre-processing </br>
•	RFM calculation </br>
•	Cluster Creation </br>

# tools

We used python program executed in Jupyter Notebook including the following packages

•	Pandas - used for pre-processing data </br>
•	matplotlib, seaborn - for visualization </br>
•	numpy - numeric data calculation </br>
•	scikit - a machine learning library </br>

# how to run the project

- git clone https://github.com/mayursrt/customer-segmentation-using-k-means.git</br>
- pip install jupyter</br>
- pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sklearn</br></br>

<i>jupyter notebook</i>
